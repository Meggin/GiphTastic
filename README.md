# GiphTastic

APIs are fun. This assignment is all about retrieving giphs from giph.com.

I started off the assignment feeling a bit worried that it seemed easier than others in the past.

But then there were a few challenges, one in particular, making sure we don't add buttons for animals that don't exist!

Asynchronous calls means you can't just set a boolean. So I had to make an ajax call twice, and restructure my code.

I suspect there's a better way to do it, but this is at least, as start.

Used bootstrap for this one too-- as it made it easier for buttons and columns and panels and stuff.

But the one tricky thing with bootstrap, is you have to rely on how it behaves, and it if isn't exactly to your liking, it can be tricky to fix.

I had to use media queries to get the menus to behave, and z-index. It's not perfect, but at least the user can do what they need to do one different device sizes without a whole lot of scroll-tastic.
